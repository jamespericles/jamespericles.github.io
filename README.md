This is a simple project utilizing bootstrap technologies assigned to me as part of my week 2 homework.

The html files all utilize elements from getbootstrap.com. This exercise was not only to familiarize myself with technologies like bootstrap, but also to lay the ground work for my portfolio, which will be worked on through the majority of this bootcamp.
